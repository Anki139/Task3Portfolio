Project Overview
This project is a modern, responsive, and personal portfolio website built to showcase the developer‚Äôs profile, technical skills, past projects, and contact information.

The portfolio consists of well-defined sections such as Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact, each crafted to convey professional details in a clean and attractive way. The website is responsive across various devices and includes light/dark mode functionality for better user experience.
